#### I began to be interested in the topic of website development for a long time. At first, these were website builders: Tilda.cc and others. Many projects have been done. But over time, this knowledge turned out to be not enough for me. And I wondered how this whole system works from the inside. So I set a new goal for myself - to study web development and everything connected with it. At the moment I am new to this business and will learn everything from scratch. I do not like to stop at what has been achieved and I am persistently looking for new branches of my development!
